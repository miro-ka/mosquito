## About

![Mosquito - backtesting](images/console_sample.png)

Mosquito is a cryptocurrency trading bot written in Python, with main focus on modularity,
so it is straight forward to plug-in new exchange.

The idea to build a new bot came because of missing following easy-access features in all of available open-source bots:
 * **Multi-currency bot** - Be able to monitor and exchange several currencies in one strategy (no need to run 5 same strategies for 5 different currencies).
 * **Easy AI plug & play** - Possibility to easily plug any of the existing AI/ML libraries (for ex. scikit or keras)

> **Please be AWARE that Mosquito is still in beta and under heavy development. Please use it in Live trading VERY carefully.**


### Supported Exchanges
Mosquito currently supports following exchanges:
 * **Poloniex** - supporting *fillOrKill* and *immediateOrCancel* trading types. *postOnly* type is not supported. You can
 read more about trading types [here.](https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex/blob/master/poloniex/__init__.py)
 * **Bittrex** - supporting *Trade Limit Buy/Sell Orders*
 * **Kucoin** - work in progress



## Requirements
 * Python 3.9
 * mongodb
 * Depending on the exchange you want to use:
   * [Poloniex-api](https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex)
   * [Bittrex-api](https://github.com/miti0/python-bittrex)



## Quick Start



### Install
 1. Clone repo
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/miti0/mosquito.git
 ```
 2. Install requirements (ideally in separate virtual environment)
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 3. Install [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) 

 4. Set-up mosquito.ini (if you want to use sample config, just rename mosquito.sample.ini to mosquito.ini)

 5. Run desired command (full list of commands below)

 All parameters in the program can be overridden with input arguments.
 You can get list of all available arguments with:

```
 python mosquito.py --help
```


## Backfill
Backfill gets history data from exchange and stores them to mongodb. Data can be after that used for testing your simulation strategies.

usage: backfill.py [-h] [--pairs PAIRS] [--all] --days DAYS

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --pairs PAIRS PairS to backfill. For ex. [BTC_ETH, BTC_* (to get all BTC_*
               prefixed pairs]
  --all        Backfill data for ALL currencies
  --days DAYS  Number of days to backfill
```


Example 1) Load historical data for BTC_ETH pair for the last 5 days:
```
python backfill.py --days 5 --pairs USDT_BTC
```

Example 2) Load historical data for ALL pairs for the last 2 days
```
python backfill.py --days 3 --all
```

Example 3) Load historical data for all pairs starting with BTC_ for the last day
```
python backfill.py --days 1 --pairs BTC_*
```



## Trading
This is the main module that handles passed strategy and places buy/sell orders.

 Architecture and logic of mosquito is made so, that it should be easy to set and tune all strategy parameters with program arguments. Below is a list of main arguments that can be either configured via the mosquito.ini config file or by passing the value/values as argument.

Currently Trading supports following modes:
 * **Backtest** - fast simulation mode using past data and placing fictive buy/sell orders.
 * **Paper** - mode simulating live ticker with placing fictive buy/sell orders.
 * **Live** - live trading with placing REAL buy/sell orders.

> Backtest and Paper trading are using immediate buy/sell orders by using the last ticker
closing price. This results to NOT 100% accurate strategy results, what you should be aware of.


### Backtest
Fast simulation mode using past data and placing fictive buy/sell orders. Simulation configuration is done via
*config.ini* file (some of the parameters can be overridden with command line arguments).

Below is an example of running a backtest together with final buy/sell plot generated at the end of the simulation.
```
python3 mosquito.py --backtest --plot
```
> ! Please be aware that Backtest should 99% work, but it is currently under final verification test.


### Paper
Trading mode that simulates live ticker with placing fictive buy/sell orders. Simulation configuration is done via
*config.ini* file (some of the parameters can be overridden with command line arguments).

Below is an example of running a backtest together with final buy/sell plot generated at the end of the simulation.
```
python mosquito.py --paper
```
> ! Please be aware that Paper should 99% work, but it is currently under final verification test.


### Live
Live trading with placing REAL buy/sell orders. Configuration is done via *config.ini* file (some of the parameters can be overridden with command line arguments).
Below is an example of running a backtest together with final buy/sell plot generated at the end of the simulation.
```
python mosquito.py --live
```
> ! Please be aware that Live should 99% work, but it is currently under final verification test.



## Plot and Statistics
Mosquito has a simple plot utility for visualizing current pair combined with trading history.
Visualization uses external library [plotly](https://plot.ly/). Below You can see an example visualizing ticker price plot, together with simulated buy/sell orders.

Below is an example of Final Simulation Report summary:
```
****************************************************
              Final simulation report:               
****************************************************
Wallet at Start: | 50.0DGB |
Wallet at End: | 51.3464723121DGB |
Strategy result: -5.68%
Buy & Hold: -8.16%
Strategy vs Buy & Hold: 2.47%
Total txn: 10
Simulated (data time): 0 days, 4 hours and 55 minutes
Transactions per hour: 2.03
Simulation run time: 0 hours 1 minutes and 13 seconds
```

## AI

### Blueprint
Blueprint is a part of AI package. Main function of the module is to generate datasets which can be used for training AI. Logic of Blueprint module is following:

 1. Create a blueprint file/module which contains features, indicators and output parameters. As an example you can take a look at ai/blueprints/minimal.py or ai/blueprints/junior.py

 2. Decide how many days you would like to run the Blueprint. Backfield data for that period.

 3. Choose which pair/pairs you would like to include. Following combinations should work [BTC_ETH] - single pair, [BTC_ETH, BTC_LTC] - list of pairs, [BTC_*] - all pairs with prefix BTC

 4. Start blueprint with following parameters (example below)

```
python blueprint.py --features junior --days 200
```

As a result you should see *.csv file in your Mosquito's **out/blueprints** folder, which should contain the dataset.


## Utilities
